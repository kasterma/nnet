# Some simple models of neurons

## linear neurons

  $$y = b + \sum_i x_i w_i$$

Here $y =$ output, and $x_i = i$-th input.  The sum is over the input connections.

## binary threshold neurons

  $$z = b + \sum_i x_i w_i$$
  $$y = \text{ if } z >= 0 \text{ then } 1 \text{ else } 0$$

Can rewrite the bias to be a threshold in the if statement (threshold should be
-b).

## rectified linear neurons

  $$z = b + \sum_i x_i w_i$$
  $$y = \text{ if } z >= 0 \text{ then } z \text{ else } 0$$

## sigmoid neurons

  $$z = b + \sum_i x_i w_i$$
  $$y = 1 / (1 + \exp(-z)) = S(z)$$
  
where S is the sigmoid function.

# Simple example of learning

Learning handwritten digits by learning templates; winner is the template that
has the most overlap (weighted) with the written digit.
